cGET is the most common HTTP method. It is used to retrieve data from the server. For example, when you visit a website in your browser, the browser sends a GET request to the server. The server then returns the HTML code for the page, which is then displayed in the browser.
POST is used to submit data to the server. For example, when you fill out a form on a website and click the Submit button, the browser sends a POST request to the server. The server then processes the data from the form and takes the appropriate action.
PUT is used to update existing data on the server. For example, if you want to change the value of a field in a database record, you would send a PUT request to the server. The server would then update the record in the database.
DELETE is used to delete data from the server. For example, if you want to delete a record from a database, you would send a DELETE request to the server. The server would then delete the record from the database.iao
